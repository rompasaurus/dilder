/* ============================================================================
 *  FreeRTOSConfig.h  —  the "settings file" for the FreeRTOS kernel
 * ============================================================================
 *
 *  WHAT IS THIS FILE?
 *  ------------------
 *  FreeRTOS is a tiny operating system kernel. Unlike a desktop OS, it is not a
 *  program you "install" — it is a *library* that gets compiled directly into
 *  our firmware. Because it has to fit on a microcontroller with kilobytes of
 *  RAM, almost every feature is optional and is switched on/off at COMPILE TIME
 *  with #define macros. This file is where we make all those choices.
 *
 *  If you come from JavaScript: think of this like a build-time `config.json`,
 *  except the values are baked into the binary by the C preprocessor before the
 *  compiler ever runs. There is no runtime config object — these are constants.
 *
 *  Every `#define configXXX  value` below sets one kernel option. The kernel's
 *  source code is full of `#if (configXXX == 1)` checks that include or exclude
 *  whole features based on what we write here.
 *
 *  WHY SO MANY OPTIONS?
 *  --------------------
 *  On a microcontroller you pay for every byte. Each feature you enable costs
 *  flash (code space) and RAM. So FreeRTOS makes you opt in to exactly what you
 *  need. We document each choice so a newcomer understands the trade-off.
 *
 *  THE BIG PICTURE FOR THIS PROJECT (Dilder Hub, RP2350 / Pico 2 W):
 *    - The RP2350 has TWO CPU cores. We run FreeRTOS in "SMP" mode (Symmetric
 *      Multi-Processing): one kernel schedules tasks across BOTH cores.
 *    - We pin the slow e-ink display work to core 1 so it can block for ~300 ms
 *      without freezing the buttons/sensors/Wi-Fi running on core 0.
 *    - See docs/03-DESIGN-AND-ARCHITECTURE.md for the full reasoning.
